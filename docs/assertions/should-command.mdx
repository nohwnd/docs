### Collect all Should failures

`Should` can now be configured to continue on failure. This will report the error to Pester, but won't fail the test immediately. Instead, all the Should failures are collected and reported at the end of the test. This allows you to put multiple assertions into one It and still get complete information on failure.

This new Should behavior is opt-in and can be enabled via `Should.ErrorAction = 'Continue'` on the configuration object or via `$PesterPreference`.

```powershell
 BeforeAll {
    function Get-User {
        @{
            Name = "Jakub"
            Age = 31
        }
    }
}

Describe "describe" {
    It "user" {
        $user = Get-User

        $user | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty -ErrorAction Stop
        $user.Name | Should -Be "Tomas"
        $user.Age | Should -Be 27

    }
}

```

This allows you to check complex objects easily without writing It for each of the properties that you want to test. You can also use `-ErrotAction Stop` to force a failure when a pre-condition is not met. In our case if `$user` was null, there would be no point in testing the object further and we would fail the test immediately.
