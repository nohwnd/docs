### Setup and teardown

Pester offers multiple ways to run code before, and after your tests to set them up, and clean up after them. The setup is represented by a `BeforeAll`, and `BeforeEach` blocks.

The teardown is used to clean up after test or a block and is guaranteed to run even if the test fails. Teardown is represented by `AfterAll` and `AfterEach` blocks.
