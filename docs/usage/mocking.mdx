Pester provides a set of Mocking functions making it easy to fake dependencies and also to verify behavior. Using these mocking functions can allow you to "shim" a data layer or mock other complex functions that already have their own tests.

## Description

With the set of Mocking functions that Pester exposes, one can:

* Mock the behavior of ANY powershell command.
* Verify that specific commands were (or were not) called.
* Verify the number of times a command was called with a set of specified parameters.

## Mocking Functions

### Mock

Mocks the behavior of an existing command with an alternate implementation.

### Assert-VerifiableMocks

Checks if any Verifiable Mock has not been invoked. If so, this will throw an exception.

### Assert-MockCalled

Checks if a Mocked command has been called a certain number of times and throws an exception if it has not.

## Example

```powershell
BeforeAll{
    function Build ($version) {
        Write-Host "a build was run for version: $version"
    }
    
    function Get-Version{
        return 'Version'
    }
    
    function Get-NextVersion {
        return 'NextVersion'
    }
    
    function BuildIfChanged {
        $thisVersion = Get-Version
        $nextVersion = Get-NextVersion
        if ($thisVersion -ne $nextVersion) { Build $nextVersion }
        return $nextVersion
    }
}

Describe "BuildIfChanged" {
    Context "When there are Changes" {
        BeforeEach{
            Mock Get-Version {return 1.1}
            Mock Get-NextVersion {return 1.2}
            Mock Build {} -Verifiable -ParameterFilter {$version -eq 1.2}
    
            $result = BuildIfChanged
        }

        It "Builds the next version" {
            Assert-VerifiableMock
        }
        
        It "returns the next version number" {
            $result | Should -Be 1.2
        }
    }
    Context "When there are no Changes" {
        BeforeEach{
            Mock Get-Version { return 1.1 }
            Mock Get-NextVersion { return 1.1 }
            Mock Build {}
    
            $result = BuildIfChanged
        }

        It "Should not build the next version" {
            Assert-MockCalled Build -Times 0 -ParameterFilter {$version -eq 1.1}
        }
    }
}
```

If you need to mock calls to commands which are made from inside a Script Module, additional code is required.  For details, refer to [Unit Testing within Modules](https://github.com/pester/Pester/wiki/Unit-Testing-within-Modules)

### Mocking a function that is called by a method in a PowerShell class

In PowerShell 6, functions called by classes can be mocked as above, with no known problems.

However previous versions of PowerShell, including **all** versions of Windows PowerShell up to 5.1 cache class definitions in such a way that they are never redefined, even if you remove the module and re-import, or modify the class. This breaks Pester's Mock command, as the scope where the mock must be injected cannot be found.

Dave Wyatt has provided this workaround:

> Simply run your Pester tests in a fresh session every time; this is simple to do with Start-Job. I have this proxy function in my PowerShell profile to help with that:

```powershell
function Invoke-PesterJob
{
[CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName='LegacyOutputXml')]
    param(
        [Parameter(Position=0)]
        [Alias('Path','relative_path')]
        [System.Object[]]
        ${Script},

        [Parameter(Position=1)]
        [Alias('Name')]
        [string[]]
        ${TestName},

        [Parameter(Position=2)]
        [switch]
        ${EnableExit},

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='LegacyOutputXml', Position=3)]
        [string]
        ${OutputXml},

        [Parameter(Position=4)]
        [Alias('Tags')]
        [string[]]
        ${Tag},

        [string[]]
        ${ExcludeTag},

        [switch]
        ${PassThru},

        [System.Object[]]
        ${CodeCoverage},

        [switch]
        ${Strict},

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='NewOutputSet', Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]
        ${OutputFile},

        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='NewOutputSet', Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateSet('LegacyNUnitXml','NUnitXml')]
        [string]
        ${OutputFormat},

        [switch]
        ${Quiet}
    )

    $params = $PSBoundParameters

    Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Set-Location $using:pwd; Invoke-Pester @using:params } |
    Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob
}
Set-Alias ipj Invoke-PesterJob

```

#### Mocks are scoped based on their placement

Mocks are no longer effective in the whole `Describe` / `Context` in which they were placed. Instead they will default to the block in which they were placed. Both of these work:

```powershell
Describe "d" {
    BeforeAll {
        function f () { "real" }
    }

    It "i" {
        Mock f { "mock" }
        f | Should -Be "mock"
    }

    It "j" {
        f | Should -Be "real"
    }
}

Describe "d" {
    BeforeAll {
        function f () { "real" }
        Mock f { "mock" }
    }

    It "i" {
        f | Should -Be "mock"
    }

    It "j" {
        f | Should -Be "mock"
    }
}
```

#### Counting mocks depends on placement

Counting mocks depends on where the assertion is placed. In `It`, `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` it defaults to `It` scope. In `Describe`, `Context`, `BeforeAll` and `AfterAll`, it default to `Describe` or `Context` based on the command that contains them. The default can still be overriden by specifying `-Scope` parameter.

```powershell

Describe "d" {

    BeforeAll {
        function f () { "real" }
        Mock f { "mock" }
    }

    It "i" {
        f
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 1
    }

    It "j" {
        f
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 1
    }

    It "k" {
        f
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 3 -Scope Describe
    }

    AfterEach {
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 1
    }

    AfterAll {
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 3
    }
}
```

#### Should -Invoke

Mock counting assertions were renamed to `Should -Invoke` and `Should -InvokeVerifiable`, and most of their parameters are no longer positional. `Assert-MockCalled` and `Assert-VerifiableMock` are provided as functions, and are deprecated.

#### Default parameters for ParameterFilter

Parameter filters no longer require you to use `param()`.

```powershell
Describe "d" {

    BeforeAll {
        function f ($a) { "real" }
        Mock f { "mock" } -ParameterFilter { $a -eq 10 }
    }

    It "i" {
        f 10
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 1
    }

    It "j" {
        f 20
        Should -Invoke f -Exactly 0
    }
}
```
