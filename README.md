This repository contains the source files for the [pester.dev](https://pester.dev) website.

The website is built using:

- [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator written in React
- [Alt3.Docusaurus.Powershell](https://docusaurus-powershell.netlify.com/), a Powershell Get-Help to markdown generator

## Local Development

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Installation

```bash

## Contributing

All website pages are written in markdown and can be located in the `/docs` folder.

To submit an update:

1. update the markdown (`.mdx`) files
2. submit a Pull Request

> ðŸ”¥ Please note that we are NOT accepting Pull Requests for the `Command Reference`

## Website Customization

All sources (except the `Command Reference`) are plain Docusaurus so
please:
